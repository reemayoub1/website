      <description>Modeling Introduction: For this project I decided to look at a data set of the population of Pima Indians in Arizona, and their diagnosis as diabetic or not. The data set includes the variables number of pregnancies (npreg), plasma glucose concentration (glu), diastolic blood pressure (bp), triceps skin fold thickness (skin), body mass index (bmi), diabetes pedigree function (ped), age and the classification as diabetic or not.
diab &amp;lt;-read.csv(&amp;quot;Pima.tr.csv&amp;quot;) diab&amp;lt;-diab%&amp;gt;%dplyr::select(-`X`)  MANOVA Briefly discuss assumptions and whether or not they are likely to have been met (2).</description>

      <description>Data Wrangling and Data Exploration Introduction For this project, I decided to look at two datasets obtained from the Toronto Police Data Portal. The first data set looks at the type of hommicides reported in different neighbourhoods in the greater Toronto area between 2004 and 2018. These types include shooting, stabbings and other. The second data set compares the counts for Assault, Auto Theft, Break and Enter, Robbery, and Theft Over by Neighbourhoods in in the Toronto Area between 2014 and 2018.</description>
